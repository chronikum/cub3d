## Notes

We have an advanced map tester, based on maps from [mlaraki](https://github.com/mlaraki/cub3D_leaks_maps_tester). It is integrated in our makefile.   

To use it, build to project in bonus or mandatory mode and then run `make map_test`

We recommend to wonderful tutorial from the amazing [lodev.org](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting2.html). It is worth the time and the read and it helped us massively doing this project.
